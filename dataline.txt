I checked the memory profile of different ways given 
in the answers using the procedure mentioned here. 
The memory usage is far better when each line is read 
from the file and processed, as suggested by @DevShark here. 
Holding all lines in a collection object is not a good idea 
if memory is a constraint or the file is large. 
The execution time is similar in both the approaches.
